## About Project

This project is to complete the final assignment for the statistics data management course during the master's degree in statistics and data science at IPB University. After learning about data management in this class, I had to apply what I had learned from the MDS course and optimize this project. So this project will continue to update from time to time. So far what I've done is:

1) Scraping data to get product info from Sephora
